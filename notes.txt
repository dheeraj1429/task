Hi, 
In client part I am using this kind of structure,

public/
|
src/
|—— components/
|	|—— Tabs/
|	|	|——Tabs.tsx
|	|	|——Tabs.styled.ts	
|	|---- Input/
|	|	|—— Input.tsx
|	|	|—— Input.styled.ts
|	|
|—— pages/
|	|—— Home/
|	|   |—— components 
|	|	|   |—— HeroSection/
|	|		    |—— Hero.tsx
|	|		    |—— Hero.styled.ts
|	|—— page.tsx
|	|				
|	|—— About/
|   |   |—— components
|	|	|   |—— OurTeam/
|	|	|	    |—— OurTeam.tsx
|	|	|	    |—— OutTeam.styled.ts
|	|	|   |—— ContactUs/
|	|	|	    |—— ContactUs.tsx
|	|	|	    |—— ContactUs.styled.ts
|	|—— page.tsx
|	|
|—— utils/
|	|—— DateTime.ts
|	|
|—— state/
|	|—— strore.ts
|	|—— hooks/
|	|	|——useAppSelector.ts
|	|	|——useAppDispatch.ts
|	| —— apis/
|	|—— features/

src/components, global components that we can use anywhere in our application
We can store our page components inside src/components folder but at that time 
it is very difficult to maintain this application if the application grows normally.

pages/**/components/** represent your local module component

I am using headless UI in some of my projects, but there are no components like buttons, 
rows, grids or others which we want. So I create my own components,

I have already created some test cases, you can find them in component/buttons/__test__

thanks!
